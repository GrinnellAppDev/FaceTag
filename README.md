###About

FaceTag is a fun game for Android and iOS, written for MHacks Winter 2014.

Set up a game with your friends and specify the duration of the game (time or points). Everyone will be given a target to tag! The first person to get a picture of their target's face gets a point and the game proceeds to the next round. 

Game Rules: 

1. Find your target and acquire a picture with their face clearly visible. 

2. Picture cannot be a picture of a picture. 
 
3. Other hunters will confirm that the picture is an original picture.
